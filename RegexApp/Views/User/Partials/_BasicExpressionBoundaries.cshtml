            <h2>1. Introduction to Expression Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Expression Boundaries are markers that allow us to anchor patterns to specific positions in the text. We'll learn about their importance and how to use them.</p>

            <h2>2. Anchoring at the Start of a Line</h2>
            <p>We'll use the <code>^</code> character to anchor patterns at the beginning of a line. We'll demonstrate how to match lines that start with specific letters.</p>
